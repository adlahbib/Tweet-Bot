# Tweet Bot

# Introduction
This is a fun little project created in python. It will fetch random image from [Unsplash](https://source.unsplash.com/) and random caption from [sassycaptions](https://sassycaptions.com/generator/). Then it will post it on twitter using tweepy.

# How to run 

  1. Fulfill requirements in ```requirements.txt```(i.e. ```pip install requirements.txt```).
  2. Replace ```XXX``` with your keys in ```main.py``` ([Get yours here](https://developer.twitter.com/)) and run it with
     ```python main.py```.
